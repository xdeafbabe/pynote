# Pynote

Note taking app. Build it with poetry and install locally.
Requires `NeoVim` and `bat` as those are my file editor and viewer of choice.
Might later make editing and viewing configurable with custom commands and args and stuff.

## Usage

Notes will be saved to `~/.notes` directory. Available commands:

```shell
note edit sample-note
     # Create or edit an existing note.
     # Launches `NeoVim` and sets syntax to Markdown.

note list
     # Lists available notes.

note view sample-note
     # View an existing note.
     # Launches `bat` and sets syntax to Markdown.

note delete sample-note
     # Deletes an existing note.
```
